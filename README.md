# Arduino Servo Swing on Steroids #

The project was for my school computer teacher, and I expanded on the code and created a ardunio servo random swing for other hobbyist. 

The schematic for the electronics are on 123d circuit Autodesk. Check it out [Random Arduino Swing](https://123d.circuits.io/circuits/1692451-random-servo-movement)
